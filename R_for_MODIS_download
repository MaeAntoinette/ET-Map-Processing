#R can also be used for downloading MODIS products in which we can bypass 
#the authentication setup that EROS put up within the past two yrs.
#View http://r-gis.net/?q=ModisDownload for more details. 

#NOTE: Read the link listed above. You must download and install the MRT tool (projection tool). Google how to install using command line. Its extremely useful to install as R can also reproject any and all MODIS maps (which you will need to do).

#This is the "raster time series" package. ModisDownload and related functions are nested within.

#This is the authetication key that we can bypass using RTS and the related functions. 
setNASAauth("USERNAME GOES HERE","PASSWORD GOES HERE") #this is your login for Earthdata EROS. 

#authetication is requried for downloading images, however you don't need it for the reprojection tool (if you've downloaded images already). 

#Set your working directory. You -must- set the WD using the modisDownload function. 
#You cannot set a variable as a working directory. ie: w.dir <- "F:/blahblabh"

#Identify where your already-installed MRT tool is located.

#Using ModisDownload, you can download maps of interest and it will save in your working directory which you set above.
